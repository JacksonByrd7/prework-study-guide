# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was my first step in learning to code, it's purpose is to organize notes in an easily readable and navigable way while I learn the basics of git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and while I attend an online coding bootcamp class.  It both has notes for basic skills using these languages while helping me become familiar with some basic skills in each language, and familiarizing myself with git and github.  Creating this webpage has led to my grasp on the basics of writing code growing to a level at which I am comfortable beginning my class.
